/**
 **
 * Request for a `TransactionGetRecord` (a.k.a. `getTxRecordByTxID`) query.
 * <p>
 * A transaction record SHALL be available after the network reaches
 * consensus and completes execution for a transaction.<br/>
 * A transaction record SHALL NOT be available after the end of the network
 * configured "record cache duration".
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>What is the "first" transaction?</dt>
 *   <dd>The "first" transaction SHALL be the the transaction with
 *       the earliest consensus time and a status that is neither
 *       `INVALID_NODE_ACCOUNT` nor `INVALID_PAYER_SIGNATURE`.<br/>
 *       If no transaction is found meeting this status criteria, the
 *       "first" transaction SHALL be the transaction with the earliest
 *       consensus time.</dd>
 *  <dt>What is a "child" transaction?</dt>
 *  <dd>A "child" transaction is any transaction created in the process of
 *      completing another transaction. These are most common with a smart
 *      contract call, where a call to a contract may initiate one or more
 *      additional transactions to complete a complex process.</dd>
