 **
 * Response message for a `getTransactionReceipts` query.
 * The `receipt` field SHALL return the receipt for the "first" transaction
 * that matches the transaction identifier requested.<br/>
 * If receipts for duplicate transactions are requested, those duplicate
 * receipts SHALL be present in the `duplicateTransactionReceipts` list.<br/>
 * If receipts for child transactions are requested, those child receipts
 * SHALL be present in the `child_transaction_receipts` list.<br/>
 * A state proof SHALL NOT be provided for this response; transaction receipts
 * are not retained in network state.
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>What is the "first" transaction?</dt>
 *   <dd>The "first" transaction receipt SHALL be the receipt for the
 *       first transaction with status that is neither
 *       `INVALID_NODE_ACCOUNT` nor `INVALID_PAYER_SIGNATURE`.<br/>
 *       If no transaction is found meeting the status criteria, the
 *       "first" transaction SHALL be the first transaction by
 *       consensus time.</dd>
 *  <dt>What is a "child" transaction?</dt>
 *  <dd>A "child" transaction is any transaction created in the process of
 *      completing another transaction. These are most common with a smart
 *      contract call, where a call to a contract may initiate one or more
 *      additional transactions to complete a complex process.</dd>
