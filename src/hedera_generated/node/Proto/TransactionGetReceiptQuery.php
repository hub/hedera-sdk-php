/**
 **
 * A query to retrieve a transaction receipt.
 * This query retrieves the post-consensus (final) result of a transaction.
 * A transaction receipt may not be available if queried too early
 * (less than 5-10 seconds), or too late (more than 3 minutes). If a receipt
 * is available, it contains basic transaction results. A query to a mirror
 * node (or other archival system) is required to obtain full detail for a
 * transaction, or any result after the basic receipt time period.
 * This query is "free". The payment field in the header MUST be empty.<br/>
 * If a receipt is not available, the response SHALL be `UNKNOWN`.<br/>
 * A transaction receipt SHALL be available after the network reaches
 * consensus for a transaction.<br/>
 * A transaction receipt SHALL NOT be available after the end of the network
 * configured "receipt period", typically three(3) minutes.
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>What is the "first" transaction?</dt>
 *   <dd>The "first" transaction SHALL be the the transaction with
 *       the earliest consensus time and a status that is neither
 *       `INVALID_NODE_ACCOUNT` nor `INVALID_PAYER_SIGNATURE`.<br/>
 *       If no transaction is found meeting this status criteria, the
 *       "first" transaction SHALL be the transaction with the earliest
 *       consensus time.</dd>
 *  <dt>What is a "child" transaction?</dt>
 *  <dd>A "child" transaction is any transaction created in the process of
 *      completing another transaction. These are most common with a smart
 *      contract call, where a call to a contract may initiate one or more
 *      additional transactions to complete a complex process.</dd>
